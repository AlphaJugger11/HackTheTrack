# GR Cup Real-Time Analytics Platform - Project Overview

## Project Vision

Build a real-time analytics and strategy platform for the GR Cup Series that transforms raw race data into actionable insights for drivers and teams. The platform will provide live performance monitoring, strategic recommendations, and post-race analysis to enhance race-day decision-making.

## Hackathon Categories

**Primary:** Real-Time Analytics
**Secondary:** Driver Training & Insights

## Core Value Propositions

1. **For Drivers:** Identify performance gaps, optimize racing lines, understand lap-to-lap improvements
2. **For Teams:** Make data-driven pit stop decisions, react to race conditions, develop winning strategies
3. **For Analysis:** Deep post-race insights revealing key moments and strategic decisions

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Python)

- Data ingestion and processing pipeline
- Real-time analytics engine
- Strategy recommendation algorithms
- Performance metrics calculation
- API layer for frontend communication

### Frontend (Interactive Dashboard)

- Live telemetry visualization
- Track position mapping
- Performance trend charts
- Strategy recommendation display
- Race replay with timeline scrubbing
- Comparative analysis views

## Key Features to Implement

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**

   - Live lap times and sector analysis
   - Position tracking and gap analysis
   - Tire degradation monitoring
   - Fuel consumption tracking

2. **Strategic Insights**

   - Optimal pit stop window calculation
   - Tire strategy recommendations
   - Pace comparison vs. competitors
   - Caution flag response scenarios

3. **Performance Analysis**

   - Racing line optimization
   - Braking point analysis
   - Corner speed comparison
   - Consistency metrics

4. **Driver Training Tools**
   - Best lap overlay comparison
   - Improvement area identification
   - Session-to-session progress tracking
   - Benchmark against top performers

## Dataset Utilization

The platform will leverage multiple track datasets (COTA, Road America, Sebring, Sonoma, VIR, Barber) to:

- Build comprehensive performance baselines
- Train predictive models
- Validate strategy algorithms
- Provide cross-track insights

## Success Metrics for Judging

**Application of Datasets:** Multi-track analysis, effective data transformation, novel metric creation
**Design:** Professional UI, intuitive UX, balanced frontend/backend
**Potential Impact:** Applicable to entire GR Cup Series, extensible to other racing series
**Quality of Idea:** Unique combination of real-time + training insights, practical racing applications

## Development Priorities

1. Core data processing pipeline
2. Key analytics algorithms (lap analysis, strategy calculations)
3. Interactive dashboard with live updates
4. Polish and user experience refinement
5. Demo video preparation showcasing real-time capabilities
