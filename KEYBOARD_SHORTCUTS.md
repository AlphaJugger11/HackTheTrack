# Keyboard Shortcuts

## Lap Navigation

When a driver is selected, you can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate through laps:

| Key               | Action             |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `←` (Arrow Left)  | Go to previous lap |
| `→` (Arrow Right) | Go to next lap     |
| `Home`            | Jump to first lap  |
| `End`             | Jump to last lap   |

## Tips

- Keyboard shortcuts only work when a driver is selected
- You'll see a hint below the lap selector showing available shortcuts
- Shortcuts work from anywhere on the page (no need to focus on a specific element)
- Use the slider or buttons if you prefer mouse/touch interaction
